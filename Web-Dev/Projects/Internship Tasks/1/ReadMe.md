# Drag-and-Drop Website Builder

This is a prototype of a drag-and-drop website builder that allows users to create websites by dragging and dropping elements onto a canvas. Users can customize elements using forms and adjust their positioning and size.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Drag elements (text, images, buttons) from the sidebar and drop them onto the canvas.
- **Form-Based Customization**: Click on an element to open a form and configure its properties (e.g., text content, font size, image URL, button color, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: The builder works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Remove Elements**: Remove elements from the canvas using the "Remove Element" button.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Drag elements from the sidebar and drop them onto the canvas.
3. Click on an element to open its properties form.
4. Adjust the element's properties (e.g., text, font size, image URL, button color, etc.).
5. Use the "Remove Element" button to delete elements from the canvas.

## Tools Used

- **HTML5 Drag and Drop API**: For drag-and-drop functionality.
- **CSS Flexbox**: For responsive layout.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic form generation and element manipulation.

## Future Improvements

- Add more elements (e.g., videos, icons, dividers).
- Constrain element positioning within the canvas boundaries.
- Save and load templates using `localStorage`.
- Add animations and hover effects for better user experience.

## Submission

- **Code Files**: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`
- **Documentation**: `README.md`
- **Video**: A short demo video showcasing the functionality.
