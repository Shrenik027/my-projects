# Environmental Impact Analysis Dashboard

*Semester 3 – Environmental Data Insights using Power BI*

---

## 🎯 Project Overview  
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize environmental metrics like carbon emissions, energy consumption, and waste generation across regions and years. Users can explore trends, filter data dynamically, and derive actionable insights.

## 📌 Key Features

- Year-over-year (YoY) trend analysis of emissions, energy, and waste  
- Region-wise breakdown and comparison  
- KPI summary cards: total CO₂, energy use intensity, waste per capita  
- Drilldown filters by sector (industrial, residential, transport)  
- Dynamic DAX measures for per-period and per-capita comparisons

---

## 👤 My Contributions

- Collected, cleaned, and merged datasets for consistency  
- Designed the KPI schema and visual analytics layout  
- Wrote DAX formulas for on-the-fly computation of growth and per-capita metrics  
- Led the final presentation and discussion in semester evaluation
